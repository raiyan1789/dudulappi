		<p>
		The Thousand Islands archipelago is located at the outlet of Lake Ontario at the head of the Saint Lawrence River. The region is bisected by the Canada-United States border and covers portions of Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties in the U.S. state of New York, in addition to parts of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and Frontenac County in the Canadian province of Ontario.

		Geologically, the islands are located where a branch of the Canadian Shield runs south across the river to join with the Adirondacks. The Thousand Islands-Frontenac Arch region was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2002.
